# Description
Well, this project of mine is completely ordinary, there is nothing new and so interesting, but I learned during classes with the project that the bootstrap grid system is very good, you can easily make your own web site responsive and this is awesome

# Task
we needed to make a mini design using bootstrap, which was shown in the picture float could not be used and it is mandatory to use bootstrap

# Usage
I used bootstrap 5.1 version, used the Gris system and added another font from the Google Font website to the styles. This played a major role in the project
