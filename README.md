## Instructions
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the layout.
3. You can modify the HTML code as needed to experiment with different layouts or styles.
4. If you need to make further changes or add custom CSS, you can do so in the `style.css` file or by linking an external CSS file.

## Additional Notes
- The layout uses Bootstrap 5 classes for styling and responsiveness.
- Each section of the layout is contained within Bootstrap grid columns.
- The header, main content, sidebar, and footer are marked with different background colors for visual distinction.
